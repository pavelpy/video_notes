1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,800
hey tech late here and welcome back to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,870
another episode of the tech lead with

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,120
the tech leads coffee time we have an

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,580
interesting topic today it is about top

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,469
things that I wish junior engineers

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,400
would know

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,769
now for those of you who are new to the

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,120
channel I wanted to briefly introduce

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,830
myself I am an ex-googler lead which is

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,320
amazing absolutely magnificent

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,180
so good it's just something to keep in

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,949
mind as you're watching my videos why

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,570
should you listen to me where is my

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,430
authority coming from why do you need to

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,090
respect me simple I'm the tech lead and

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,590
that's something that you probably

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,050
couldn't say about anybody else that you

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,690
know not your dad not your mom

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,520
not your brother or sister or your

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,190
friends and if you can't say this about

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,110
somebody then you just need to keep in

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,760
mind that they're not necessarily the

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,920
tech leader i am the tech lead there can

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,620
be only one tech lead and that is me you

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,360
can confirm that by checking the user

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,309
name on my youtube channel it says tech

27
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,870
lead right there that confirms that i

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,090
have taken up that name and that's

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,769
really why you should listen to me

30
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,540
that's really the basis for my whole

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,430
entire youtube channel so without

32
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,140
further ado let's get into our sponsor

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,330

41
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,210
them and think about them throughout

42
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,710
your day studying them when you're bored

43
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,240
I'll be doing them too so check them out

44

daily coding problems comm slash tech

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,840
lead so let's get into the first tip

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,460
here we have a junior engineer his name

47
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,290
is Jake and he writes in that he's got a

48
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,540
Software Architect at work disagrees

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,130
with the way to software architect is

50
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,590
doing things he sees a way to solve the

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,869
past the problem they've been given in a

52
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,579
much simpler way and then meanwhile the

53
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,200
Software Architect left for three weeks

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,630
came back with 50,000 lines of code of

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,610
sequel code and said that we have to use

56
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,649
that as a framework and meanwhile Jake

57
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,060
just feels that there's just a much

58
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
simpler way of doing this thing and Jake

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,420
is just thinking that the software

60
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,210
architect is ridiculous now little does

61
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,219
Jake know but this r4 architect is

62
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,649
actually me that's right Jake I am on

63
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:08,068
your team

64
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,449
I am the software architect that you've

65
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,220
been complaining about I don't actually

66
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,930
look like this in real life I put on the

67
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,380
mask

68
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,880
that people don't actually know who I am

69
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,010
but Jake I know who you are I know

70
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,900
you're complaining about me at work I'm

71
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,460
going to make sure that you get what you

72
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,680
deserve okay so now let me just address

73
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,050
for you Jake what's going on the reason

74
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,850
that I went out and wrote 50,000 lines

75
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,700
of code okay is because Tec is not

76
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,240
necessarily about being right there are

77
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,430
a lot of things about computer science

78
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,590
but being right is not one of them if

79
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,090
you only cared about being right I

80
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,100
recommend that you go become a professor

81
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,720
and you can get into all the academics

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,310
about this but computer science

83
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,290
programming specifically is the

84
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,410
application of code and the application

85
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,840
the practical application is messy it's

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,150
dirty reality is ugly and there can be

87
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,950
many aspects beyond just being right

88
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,960
when I see somebody go out and write 50

89
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,370
thousand lines of over-engineered

90
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,810
garbage code you have to think about

91
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,850
what their motive is is it simply

92
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,920
because they're stupid is it simply

93
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,090
because you're just trying to over

94
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,470
engineer a bunch of stuff waste a bunch

95
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,850
of time no I don't think so

96
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,290
the reason they're doing this is such

97
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,670
that they can carve out an ownership

98
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,160
area for themselves for their team they

99
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,870
can show that project to management they

100
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,490
can show to everybody and Jake if you

101
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,720
can get on board with the Software

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,200
Architect

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
help that person build out this huge

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
project that person is already doing the

105
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,690
bulk of the work fifty thousand lines of

106
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,670
code already in there for you free and

107
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,040
you just go help out start building some

108
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,570
of this stuff out you can become part

109
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,850
time owners of just brand-new project

110
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,680
and it can lead to great things for you

111
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
and your team so that's the first thing

112
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,250
is that there can be many different

113
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,440
aspects and I might remind you that this

114
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,510
isn't necessarily simply about politics

115
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,459
although politics may play a big part at

116
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,840
work and you just need to keep that in

117
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,310
mind but there could be some very good

118
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,170
reasons for this for example one time I

119
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,280
was working in the company

120
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,800
I saw a far greater easier way to build

121
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,940
something I would just say hey let's

122
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,260
just take this component from

123
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,940
open-source let's just use that ship

124
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,010
this project we're done two days but

125
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,720
this person wanted to spend months

126
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
building on this project and I didn't

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,410
understand why this person would be

128
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,150
going around trying to do all this work

129
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,100
until later on I realized that there are

130
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,290
a lot of actual benefits real practical

131
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,810
benefits for example having ownership of

132
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,520
something could let you modify the code

133
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,350
more easily you could adapt that however

134
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,660
you wanted to you could really make it

135
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,790
flexible you can support your team your

136
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,590
certain technologies you can make it a

137
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,419
much bigger longer-term project and

138
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,010
stuff just solving one small short-term

139
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,280
goal finishing

140
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,620
shipping the product and moving on maybe

141
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,389
you could actually turn this into a much

142
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,160
bigger framework something that could be

143
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,320
useful and supported and used across

144
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,030
many different teams within your company

145
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,669
and if you have that long-term vision

146
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,080
then you may see that there's really

147
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,900
much more that may be doable sometimes

148
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,340
you don't want to be right it's a lot

149
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,020
like when you're driving and somebody

150
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,700
cuts you off if you continue driving

151
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,740
into this person yeah you're gonna be

152
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,300
right in the eyes of the law you'll be

153
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,190
right but you'll also be dead now the

154
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,389
second thing I want Eugene your

155
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,550
engineers to know is to pick your

156
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,460
battles and this also has to do with not

157
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,200
necessarily being right all the time

158
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,210
because if you take a look at this

159
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,860
junior engineer Jake here the

160
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,720
disagreement with a senior engineer and

161
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,430
what really happens is that these senior

162
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,930
engineers your colleagues they're going

163
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,669
to be the ones writing your peer reviews

164
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,169
and it's just not going to do you any

165
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,669
good if you start causing conflict with

166
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,380
people in your area the best way to

167
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,270
deliver criticism if you're going to do

168
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,190
it is to ask questions ask questions

169
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,780
such that people can think about the

170
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,610
problem think about how to answer that

171
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,590
if they can't find an answer maybe then

172
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,970
you would have shown them the problem

173
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,950
encourage them to the justice solution

174
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,200
and save some face instead of having you

175
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,330
just come in and point out that they're

176
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,740
wrong and embarrass them in front of

177
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,270
everybody the other thing is it's

178
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,740
actually going to be in your best

179
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,710
interest to get this senior engineer

180
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,140
promoted such that it makes space for

181
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,760
you of course if this person doesn't

182
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,370
deserve promotion then fine but it's

183
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,690
often going to be in your interest to

184
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,910
support your tech lead and this is why I

185
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,440
say a lot of people think that I'm

186
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,090
joking when I say that your job is to

187
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,460
support your tech lead but it's going to

188
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,720
be in your interest to just make sure

189
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,460
that the people around you your ho team

190
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,680
everybody is doing well getting promoted

191
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,900
you will rise as a team or you will sink

192
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,880
as a team and as you clear up space

193
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,470
above you then there's going to be more

194
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,050
space for you to grow sanzu in the art

195
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,150
of war he wrote that the supreme art of

196
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,130
war is to subdue your enemies without

197
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,440
fighting supreme excellence consists of

198
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,479
breaking the enemy's resistance without

199
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,400
fighting now tip number three is to

200
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,990
remember that nobody cares about the

201
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,729
details nobody actually reads the code

202
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,530
you're the only one who reads it and so

203
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,729
when you go around complaining that

204
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,950
there's some abstract abstract factory

205
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,350
factory coordinator manager and that is

206
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,180
causing the pixel padding to be off by

207
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,979
two points no one really understands

208
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,120
what you're talking about and no one

209
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,770
really cares it's just like just get it

210
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,200
done right I don't care just get it done

211
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,940
we just want to see this task done and

212
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,290
to be able to move forward and what you

213
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,090
need to do is bring your conversation up

214
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,350
a level such that people can actually

215
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,850
understand what you're talking about

216
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,530
what people care about are the top-line

217
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,750
metrics the product the code meanwhile

218
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,790
would be changing every day whenever I

219
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,500
go into meetings I always see the junior

220
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,780
engineers start diving really deep into

221
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
small little grungy details you know

222
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,720
these people they're really boring

223
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,250
everybody they're wasting a bunch of

224
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,530
time what you need to do is set the

225
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,850
proper expectations

226
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,890
instead of making excuses about some

227
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,050
factory factory manager tell people when

228
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,610
your projects being done why it's being

229
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,020
blocked what it's going to look like

230
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,880
just set those expectations and that's

231
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,230
really all anybody really cares about

232
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,930
tip number four is to stop fixing all

233
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,550
those bugs that I've been assigning you

234
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,130
the fact is that there are millions of

235
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,380
bugs and I just pick one or two and I

236
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,820
send them your way and then you suddenly

237
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,620
start thinking that they're so important

238
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,690
and you focus on them all the time and

239
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,830
you just keep talking about these

240
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,080
smaller bugs and yeah you can solve them

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,430
and that's great I'll just assign you

242
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,600
some more and there's just going to be

243
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,370
an infinite amount and your real goal is

244
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,140
not to focus so much on all these small

245
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,460
little bugs that you've been assigned

246
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,140
because it's not going to make a dent

247
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,760
and it doesn't really matter what you're

248
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,140
really ought to do is to take on

249
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,330
initiative to take ownership in an area

250
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,730
and by taking on ownership you can build

251
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,590
something that can help expand the

252
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,230
team's roles responsibilities such that

253
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,270
your team can grow get more budget hire

254
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,830
more people and make more impact

255
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,600
everything you do is really for this

256
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
broader role the task of solving a few

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,530
bugs here and there that's always going

258
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,300
to be there and people can always hire

259
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,340
another junior engineer to be doing that

260
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,690
you won't be looking a little bit

261
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,370
broader than that everything before you

262
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,960
can do that it's going to be training to

263
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,000
get you to that point the last and final

264
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,670
tip for you here is to take in some

265
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,500
feedback you want to get out of your

266
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,360
comfort zone when you're not comfortable

267
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,950
that is when you're learning we are in

268
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,510
difficult situations that you're not

269
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,550
familiar with when you're doing tasks

270
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,570
that you don't know if you can

271
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,400
accomplish or not when you're being

272
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,169
challenged that is when you are growing

273
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,840
and similarly feedback will always make

274
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,120
anybody uncomfortable because that is

275
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,309
when you start understanding where you

276
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,990
messed up where you could have improved

277
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,030
upon feedback is generally something

278
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,920
that you need somebody else to tell you

279
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,420
because when you look at yourself you

280
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,490
won't be able to see your own flaws you

281
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,440
don't know what you don't know which is

282
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,420
why you need a third party somebody

283
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,790
senior somebody like me that

284
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,220
lead to tell you what your flaws are

285
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,320
where you can improve and obtaining the

286
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,540
sort of feedback it's not necessarily

287
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,280
going to be that easy if you show that

288
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,320
you cannot accept the feedback if you

289
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,850
show that you're always challenging the

290
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,040
tech lead trying to come up against them

291
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,780
trying to disrupt their flow then

292
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,980
they're not going to really give you

293
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,570
honest good feedback they'll just say

294
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,370
yeah you're doing fine and you're going

295
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,140
to be left struggling over and over

296
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,910
because people are just not really

297
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,560
willing to provide you good honest

298
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,090
feedback because it doesn't seem like

299
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,440
you're willing and able to accept that

300
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,300
when you can show that you are willing

301
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,430
to learn willing to obey me

302
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,370
word for word I tell you to do something

303
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,860
and you do it then you are going to be

304
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,060
in a state in which you are ready to

305
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,430
accept feedback in which I can tell you

306
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,170
where you need to improve and then you

307
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,240
can go off and improve yourself my first

308
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,220
assignment for you is to subscribe to

you will be well on your way to not

312
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,000
becoming a junior software engineer and

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
without though for me I hope you found

314
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,210
these tips useful if you didn't just

315
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,370
remember that I am the X Go Go tech lead

316
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,930
let me know your thoughts on junior

317
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,490
software engineers if you like the video
