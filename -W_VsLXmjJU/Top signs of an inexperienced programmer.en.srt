00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
hey tech light here and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,750
another episode today we are going to

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,520
talk about the top signs of an

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,280
inexperienced programmer it is coffee

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,380
time we are having a coca-cola a lot of

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,980
people like to hate on coca-cola but

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,680
it's not so bad nothing wrong with that

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,619
this video is sponsored by coca-cola for

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,560
fun times have a coca-cola is what I

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,660
would not say because I'm not sponsored

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,869
by coca-cola this video by the way is

to audio books on my commute saving a

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,360
lot of time currently I'm listening to 0

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,370
to 1 by Peter Thiel that's great book

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,170
lots of lessons from experienced people

of the boat ride home slash tech elite

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,370
you know it's a funny thing that all new

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,350
engineers exhibit certain traits and

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,719
just by looking at the way they act the

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,219
patterns that they go about in their

29
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,140
daily routines the code that they output

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,909
you can pretty much tell who's an

31
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,619
experienced engineer and who's new and

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,630
these new engineers all go through the

33
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,939
same things and it takes them sometimes

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,860
months sometimes years to outgrow their

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,680
behaviors to turn pro so to speak every

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
new engineer has to go through this

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
training and every single company and

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
it's just tiresome these same lessons

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
need to be repeated over and over again

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,350
I thought I would just give you guys the

41
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,119
basic tip such that when you get started

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
or if you're already working then you're

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
going to be well on your way and people

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,250
aren't going to have to give to you the

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,290
same lessons over and over again you

46
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,000
know it's funny that when you start

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,710
working at say a company like Google

48
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,380
they like to haze you in your first code

49
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,600
reviews they will leave you hundreds if

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,460
not millions of comments in your first

51
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,680
div output that you're trying to commit

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
and people just say hey this is wrong

53
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,130
this line of code wrong this line of

54
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,229
code bad there would be so many pedantic

55
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,909
comments that many people just end up

56
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,070
quitting the next day and that's the

57
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,329
funny thing a lot of people don't know

58
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,219
is that of the people who get in to say

59
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,350
Google as an engineer about half quit

60
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,969
before they even submit their first line

61
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,399
of code so let's get into it the first

62
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,619
tip and this has been repeated over and

63
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,229
over again is keep your dev sizes small

64
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,599
keep your commit small chances are when

65
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,740
you first start you're going to

66
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,720
a starter project that's going to

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,580
require a sizeable chunk of code to

68
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,590
complete some feature and the key to

69
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,060
know here is this isn't so much about

70
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,680
completely in the future it's probably a

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
useless feature that nobody even cares

72
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,550
about what people really want to see you

73
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,410
do is start learning the coding practice

74
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,110
is the development process in which you

75
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,640
get a code submitted and this really

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,020
involves the process in which you break

77
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,820
down the project into bite-sized chunks

78
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,920
and you submit targeted small pieces of

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,230
code one at a time instead of submitting

80
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,930
the whole thing and chances are when you

81
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,670
submit this whole piece of code for a

82
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,530
code review and it's thousands of lines

83
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,000
of code people are just going to look at

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,250
it and say hey yeah this one line here

85
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,660
this one way that you did this was

86
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,070
entirely wrong and the whole thing needs

87
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,690
to be redone when you get started

88
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,070
there's a high chance you're going to

89
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,960
fundamentally get some pattern some

90
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,670
design or architecture of your program

91
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,590
wrong it's going to change the whole way

92
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,240
that the thing is going to be written so

93
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,590
if you submit small-sized ifs

94
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,330
incrementally people can help make sure

95
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,950
that you're on the right track you're

96
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,780
not wasting too much time and it also

97
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,460
makes it easier to land your diffs

98
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,930
because it's simply easier to get

99
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,880
approval on small size chunks of code

100
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,160
are very targeted instead of a whole

101
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,380
menagerie of random divs many times I

102
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,090
will actually write my code in an editor

103
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,950
that shows line by line tips of what

104
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,990
changes are making like Visual Studio

105
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,450
code or Adam will show this and this

106
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,740
helps ensure that you're not just

107
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,330
changing random lines of text that don't

108
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,160
need to be changed almost every company

109
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,750
I go through they beat this one lesson

110
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,330
about having small tips over and over to

111
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,580
new engineers if you go into the company

112
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,720
already knowing this you're going to be

113
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,140
set

114
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,000
now the second sign of a new and

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,190
experienced developer is just crazy

116
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,560
tangled code crazy logic all over the

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,750
place huge functions tons of if

118
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,520
statements all over the place random

119
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,290
helper methods everywhere premature

120
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,390
optimization over engineered garbage

121
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,670
code and so country - what you might

122
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,920
imagine bad code is not simply code that

123
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,600
has a ton of bugs doesn't compile

124
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,850
doesn't work a decent engineer will at

125
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,990
least be able to get their code to

126
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,300
compile to work and is even going to run

127
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
and function okay but the way the logic

128
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,340
is set up the way the code is written is

129
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,930
going to look completely horrible it's

130
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,850
gonna look like garbage code tangled

131
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,279
totally messy complex stuff and it's

132
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,810
pretty much going to be a complete pain

133
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,670
to read many times I would just get a

134
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,410
headache after reading some beginners

135
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,880
code and then I have to get up and get a

136
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,950
coffee break my recommendation here is

137
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,270
write at design talk

138
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,190
right a document that describes what

139
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,449
you're going to build what the future

140
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,400
requirements are how you're going to set

141
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,110
things up which functions you're going

142
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,550
to need which classes what data

143
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,319
structures you might need and then just

144
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,210
go build those out and that should help

145
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,310
you organize your ideas is very obvious

146
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,780
actually when I see code that was

147
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,280
written without design dog because

148
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,770
there's just repeated duplicate code

149
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,259
logic if statements all over the place

150
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,840
it somehow manages to work I mean the

151
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,430
code is going to work fine but it's just

152
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,229
going to look like pretty crazy code I'm

153
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,520
probably going to go ahead and approve

154
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,020
your code anyway but I know it's going

155
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,419
to cause you a lot of hell later on as

156
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,440
you're going to become the one

157
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,729
maintaining this code throughout your

158
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,080
career and it's just going to slow you

159
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,270
down through the rest of your job over

160
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,620
the months as you're going to have to

161
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,090
start adding features to this code

162
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,319
you're going to have to start reading it

163
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,460
and there's just going to be bugs

164
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,440
introduced every single time you tried

165
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,270
to modify the code you're going to have

166
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,830
to make changes in the whole bunch of

167
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,750
different areas the logic is going to be

168
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,789
pretty loopy right design dog save

169
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,349
yourself sometimes gonna make you look a

170
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,229
little bit better too the third trait of

171
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,419
a new and experienced developer is low

172
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,520
effectiveness now don't get me wrong

173
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,050
everyone's working hard everyone's

174
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,400
trying to prove themselves they know

175
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
they're new they're trying to do things

176
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,969
but they're just not effective and they

177
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,490
end up wasting tons of time I know guy

178
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,199
who was working on this feature for

179
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,090
months and it was a pretty complicated

180
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,430
UI in fact the UI was essentially

181
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,409
impossible to do you know the UI

182
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,120
designers just came up with it and he

183
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,860
started trying to work on it and coming

184
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,259
up with totally convoluted code none of

185
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,550
it was really done well it was very

186
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,460
hacky stuff and I think he just wasn't

187
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,139
having his eye on the goal he was just

188
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,909
obsessed with maybe doing a bunch of

189
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,130
groundwork this project never launched

190
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,530
by the way and later on I came up with a

191
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,569
better solution for it I pushed back on

192
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,400
the UI designers loop and said hey if we

193
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,110
do it this way it's going to be much

194
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,460
easier to implement it's going to look

195
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,080
good too and so I would say don't just

196
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,569
code for coding sake look at the forest

197
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:17,280
not the trees keep your eye on the

198
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,810
vision the goal that you're trying to

199
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,610
make happen and make sure that your code

200
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,380
at least ships and if you don't foresee

201
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,550
your code ship and try to clear the

202
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,199
roadblocks for that make sure that you

203
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,419
can get your impact in where you can you

204
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,520
also want to keep an eye on your APM

205
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,620
actions per minute I don't love

206
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,690
engineers they go in and they spend the

207
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,159
whole day surfing reddit checking

208
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,380
Facebook social media blogs Twitter

209
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,169
surfing news and I look at these new

210
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:40,830
engineers

211
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,509
half the time they're watching a YouTube

212
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,860
video of someone playing the game maybe

213
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,270
they're the one playing the game maybe

214
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,039
they're even broadcasting that game and

215
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,810
that's all great people can work like

216
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,580
that think of work on their own time if

217
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,289
they like and I used to sort of do this

218
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,120
- I was going to work and I would have

219
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,710
one window maybe I'll do some online

220
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,720
shopping whatever it is I want to do but

221
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,009
the thing is when you play a game like

222
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,750
Starcraft you notice that whoever has

223
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,490
the highest APM usually wins the match

224
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,530
in the Starcraft game not always but

225
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,909
usually it really goes a long way so

226
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,740
that's really the same thing for

227
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,750
developers as well if you're spending

228
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,580
any available time you have on the job

229
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,259
for instance just imagine how much more

230
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,960
productive you might be able to be you

231
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,460
know you could get probably a lot more

232
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,620
code submitted read a lot Co learn about

233
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,419
the codebase come up with ideas you

234
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,830
could get a whole bunch done and I would

235
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,300
say that one flaw of new engineers is

236
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,800
sometimes I'll take a look at that code

237
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,229
output after a whole week and they may

238
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,360
have submitted like one or two pieces of

239
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,919
code the whole week and just a reminder

240
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,319
how is it possible that somebody could

241
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,449
spend five days I had a job and some a

242
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,069
only two pieces of code or even one

243
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,870
piece of code or none in the whole week

244
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,000
and then I remember oh yeah that's right

245
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
they were probably playing games that

246
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,029
whole time maybe they were doing online

247
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,699
shopping who knows and it's kind of no

248
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,440
wonder that for a lot of these people

249
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,690
their productivity is just very low my

250
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,219
recommendation is tried to get at least

251
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,719
one piece of code so made that per day

252
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,580
that'll keep you on track make that just

253
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,110
a personal go for yourself that'll keep

254
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,060
you going the fourth son of an

255
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,650
experienced engineer is they usually

256
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,690
have a lot of pride a lot of ego a lot

257
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,490
of arrogance and this is something that

258
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,199
you see other lot of computer science

259
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,789
students coming out of college for

260
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,680
instance their arrogance is just

261
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,539
incredible the worst is when I'm

262
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,610
reviewing a new engineers code and I

263
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,810
decide to leave like say a hundred

264
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,029
comments and then the engineer comes by

265
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,889
my desk and personally asks me about

266
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,750
each comment and tries to justify why

267
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,580
he's right about each one and then I

268
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,169
have to get in a little argument about

269
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,090
each one with him and he's trying to

270
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,770
defend himself and laughing at other

271
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,479
people who may be more stupid than him

272
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,949
trying to sound cool trying to sound

273
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,320
smart it's like look I don't care if you

274
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,820
think you're cool I don't care if you

275
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,260
think I think you're cool if you want me

276
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,909
to say you're cool fine you're cool I'm

277
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,890
cool we're all cool everybody's cool I'm

278
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,469
just cooler than you okay so the thing

279
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,269
about arrogance is it has a lot of other

280
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,579
effects as well for example it causes

281
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,770
engineers to over engineer their code to

282
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,300
make it look really smart and clever

283
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,730
keep it simple also I would recommend

284
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,500
that you swallow

285
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,120
your pride and go as for questions as

286
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,860
for help when you need it it can save

287
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,480
you a ton of time this kind of goes back

288
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,940
to being ineffective love new engineers

289
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,290
just want to tackle everything on their

290
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,640
own they spend a lot of time doing

291
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,110
things on their own a week or two later

292
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,880
they surface again with a bunch of

293
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,710
garbage code that they've written and I

294
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,910
have to say this whole thing was wrong

295
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,410
this whole thing was just no good I wish

296
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,910
they would just asked an experienced

297
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,980
developer like myself what I would've

298
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,240
approved and that could have saved

299
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,490
everyone a lot of time my last time

300
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,170
final tip the sign of an inexperienced

301
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,120
engineer is somebody who does not

302
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,610
identify and respect the tech lead

303
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,010
that's me make sure that you know who

304
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,870
the tech lead is I'm not talking about

305
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,520
your manager I'm not talking about your

306
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
boss you may already have a tech lead at

307
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,210
your company that may not be the tech

308
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,980
lead that person could be X Microsoft

309
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,000
for example I am X Google ok X could go

310
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,590
tech lead you want to make sure you know

311
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,150
who the tech lead is now I have a story

312
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,770
for you one time there was this engineer

313
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,840
he did not respect the tech lead he

314
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,970
dared not to and let me just tell you

315
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,380
what happened to him because this is

316
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,880
going to be a good lesson for all of you

317
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
he started proposing tons of random code

318
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,920
for his project no design doc huge tips

319
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
very complicated logic and I pushed back

320
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,510
on and said yeah this isn't going to

321
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,580
work he did not respect my comments and

322
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,200
kept pushing forward with his code he

323
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
kept proposing tons of code disappeared

324
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
came back two weeks later with a bunch

325
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,500
more additional code didn't listen to a

326
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,330
single comment that I suggested for him

327
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,310
and I blocked every single code that he

328
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,690
tried to put in that's right I would

329
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,220
block his code I would just spend all my

330
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,930
time writing millions of comments and he

331
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,280
would have to write millions of replies

332
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,410
back eventually we started just writing

333
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,480
essays on these tips we stopped coding

334
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,339
really his effectiveness his code output

335
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,170
dropped to zero you know what happened

336
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,140
to him he got fired that's right so

337
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,880
that's one lesson for you if you don't

338
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,220
respect the tech lead I would recommend

339
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,589
if I are you to actually be nice to the

340
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,060
tech lead do whatever you can for him

341
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,710
you know bring him lunch bring him tea

342
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,900
one little trick you can do is instead

343
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,850
of having you submit code come up with a

344
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,360
diff

345
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,430
mail it to the tech lead and then the

346
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,870
tech lead to a patch your dip in and

347
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,060
then submit that for you and that way

348
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,980
the tech lead will get credit for the

349
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,339
dips

350
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,720
it just helps increase the number of

351
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,370
dips that the tech leader is putting out

352
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,040
what you can also do is when you write

353
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,110
design documents but the tech Lee's name

354
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,760
on it even if I have no part in the

355
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,130
design dock or presentation or email or

356
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,420
post or whatever it is that your

357
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,250
writing just put my name there in the

358
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,019
authors to credit this line that would

359
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,430
be great I would appreciate that that

360
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,899
helps me get a little bit more credit a

361
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,670
little bit more awareness for people

362
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,760
like me who are here to take credit for

363
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,740
your work buying me stuff give me things

364
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,899
give me money any of that I'll take it

365
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,880
